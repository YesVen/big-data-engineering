For every input-split and mapper there will be one RecordReader(It is an interface).
In Hadoop technology, you should not call line, lines are called as records.

RecordReader will read one line from the input-split and convert it into key-value-pair.
There are 4 formats of your file that RecordReader understands: Files should be either of these 4 formats:
1)TextInputFormat (by default)
2)KeyValueTextInputFormat
3)SequenceFileInputFormat
4)SequenceFileAsTextInputFormat

ByteOffset is the address of the line.
Number of lines in your input split, those many times your mapper would be running.
2 Lines in input-split, so 2 key-value pairs will be generated.
